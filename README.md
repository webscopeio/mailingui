# Mailing UI

## Description

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components, built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), designed to make the creation of emails easier.

> "We believe that email is an extremely important medium for people to communicate. However, we need to stop developing emails like 2010, and rethink how email can be done in 2022 and beyond. Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build web apps today"  
â€”[React.email](https://react.email).

All of our components are completely **open-sourced** and intended for a
*copy-and-paste* use. Currently, we don't have any plans in releasing MailingUI as an npm
package.
