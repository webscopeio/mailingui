# Mailing UI

## Description

Mailing UI is an _open source_ collection of email components (templates coming soon!) that can help you save time and improve your email campaigns.

All of the components are designed to be visually appealing and easy to use.

Since the Mailing UI is open source, you can use any part of it for free and modify it to suit your needs!

The project is an MVP. We plan on adding new features in the near future.

### Technology stack

The website is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). We use the experimental (beta) [app](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/defining-routes) directory. The email components are showcased on the website.
