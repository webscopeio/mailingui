# Mailing UI

## Description

Mailing UI is an _open source_ collection of email components and templates that can help you save time and improve your email campaigns.

All the components are designed to be visually appealing and easy to use.

Since the Mailing UI is open source, you can use any part of it for free and modify it to suit your needs!

> The project is an MVP. We plan on adding new features in the near future.

## Documentation

To learn how to use our components, please visit [mailingui.com/components](https://mailingui.com/components).
To use our free templates navigate to [mailingui.com/preview](https://mailingui.com/preview) and copy the templates
from there. Keep in mind that for the templates to work you need to have the used components installed and set up.
