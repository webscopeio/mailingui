# Mailing UI

## Description

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components built on top of [React.email](https://react.email) designed to make the creation of emails easier.

All of our components are completely open-sourced and intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets. Right now, we have no plans on creating an npm package for the components.
