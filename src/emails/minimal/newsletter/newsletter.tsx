                <b>16 months ago</b>, we wrote about how a startup called
                ChiselStrike was building a serverless platform that let you
                create RESTful backends with simple TypeScript definitions.
              </P>
              <P>
                <b>10 months later</b>, they launched a private beta of Turbo ‚Äî
                an edge-hosted, distributed DB that lets you bring your data to
                the edge with their forked version SQLite called libSQL.
              </P>
              <P>
                That got a lot of folks real excited ‚Äî because running your app
                on the edge is great, but it won&apos;t actually be any faster
                unless your data is on the edge too. And Turbo gave us all a
                pretty easy way to do that.
              </P>
              <P>
                Fast forward to today, and the team has become much more
                well-known for Turbo than for their OG ChiselStrike platform. So
                they decided to embrace the wisdom of the crowd by changing
                their name to Turbo and focusing 100% of their efforts on the
                edge DB platform.

                Some might call this selling out, but hey ‚Äî nobody knew who
                Stefani Germanotta was until she started making pop hits for the
                masses and changed her name to Lady Gaga.
