### Recap of [#420](#)

![Speaker](/newsletter/speaker.png "Lights, Camera, Action")

- Andy Warfield wrote an in-depth article on Dr Werner's blog about what is was like [Building and operating a pretty big storage system called S3](#)
- Vercel just introduced [react-tweet](#), which lets you embed tweets into any React app with a single line of code. It comes with RSC support, less client-side JavaScript, and it already needs to be renamed üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- Brian Rinaldi wrote this touching [Jamstack Eulogy](#), which sparked some debate among all the pro-Jammies and anti-Jammies out there.
- [Remix-Dev-Tools](#) makes it easier to monitor and manage page info, URL parameters, server responses, and more in your Remix apps.
- In a classic case of ‚Äúif you can't beat 'em, join 'em‚Äù, Stack Overflow just released [Overflow AI](#). It's kind of like ChatGPT, but it gives a different company money when you ask it questions.
