We're excited to announce the release of Mailing UI, an open-source collection of email components and templates to help you save time building transactional emails within your system.

[Webscope.io](http://webscope.io/) has delivered many complex web portals and mobile applications over the past few years. We've also refactored many legacy systems. We've identified some common pain points in building SaaS products during this period. Building and maintaining transactional emails is definitely one of them.


## Motivation

Building emails, especially in the old times, using HTML was hard and unmaintainable. Many developers just wanted to avoid it and hoped someone else would handle it. But let's admit it - emails are essential to almost all products.

Some great editors now allow you to create beautiful marketing emails. However, transactional emails are a bit different. You need to compose them programmatically and adjust them to various users. You need different things based on the system and user variables, support internationalization, etc.

Here are some of the facts that we consider the most challenging:

- Reliable rendering in all major clients
- Keeping emails consistent and composable
- Support for i18n, dark mode, and other essential features

The good thing is that react.email and MJML projects solve many of these issues making the whole process much better nowadays.

## Solution

Our Mailing UI component library helps you bootstrap your emails quickly with these technologies by  providing you with ready-to-use components that: 

- Are exportable as Plain HTML/MJML/react.email
- Render nicely on major clients (we test everything with [https://testi.at/](https://testi.at/))
- Look nicely in dark mode

We have started with a simple set of atomic components, and we're already working hard on making more complex ones. We will also deliver some ready-to-use templates soon. If you want to stay in touch, feel free to star us on GitHub or subscribe to our newsletter on our homepage.

We've launched early because we want to get feedback, and we'd really appreciate it if you could provide us with some on Twitter or using GitHub discussions.
