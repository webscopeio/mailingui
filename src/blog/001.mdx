We're excited to announce the release of **Mailing UI**, an _open source_ collection of email templates that can help you save time and improve your email campaigns. Mailing UI offers a wide variety of email templates for different purposes, including welcome emails, promotional emails, newsletters, and more.

All of the templates are designed to be visually appealing and easy to use, with customizable fields that you can fill in with your own content. One of the benefits of Mailing UI is that it's open source, which means you can use it for free, modify it to suit your needs, and contribute your own templates back to the community.

## How to get started?

To get started with Mailing UI, simply visit the library from our website or GitHub repository, explore what our components, source what you need and you're ready to go. We're working on including guided documentation to help you get started, and we're always available to answer any questions you may have.

## A valuable resource for the community

We believe that Mailing UI will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their email campaigns. Email is still one of the most effective ways to reach your audience, and Mailing UI can help make that process easier and more efficient.

Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing how you use Mailing UI to create amazing emails that engage and delight your audience.
