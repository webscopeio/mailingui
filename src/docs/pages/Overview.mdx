# MailingUI components

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components designed to make the creation of emails easier.

All of our components are intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets, you **cannot install MailingUI
as a dependency**.
Right now, we have no plans on creating an npm package for the components.
