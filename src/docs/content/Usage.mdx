# Usage

As **MailingUI** is set of email components built with help of [react-email](https://react.email) library, it reuse its rendering capabilities for preparing correct HTML markup for email clients. With rendered HTML markup you can send emails with help of any email sending service or library.

Here we present quick guide how to use **MailingUI** with [Resend](https://resend.com/) or [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) libraries.

## Using Resend

### Install dependencies

For **MailingUI** install [see Installation section](/installation).

```bash
npm install resend
```

### Create email template

You can use both **MailingUI** components installed and and any other **react-email** components to create email template. For example:

<EmailSourceTabs emailId="hello-world" />

### Send email

Given **Resend** is operated by same team as **react-email**, email rendering is built-in in **Resend's SDK**. Thus you can use its sendEmail method directly.

```js
import { Resend } from "resend";
import { HelloWorldEmail } from "./hello-world";

const resend = new Resend("resend-api-key");

resend.sendEmail({
  from: "mailingui@example.com",
  to: "user@mail.com",
  subject: "hello world",
  react: <HelloWorldEmail />,
});
```
