# MailingUI components

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components designed to make the creation of emails easier.
All of our
components are intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets.
Right now, we are not planning on releasing an npm package for the components.

## Installation

To start using MailingUI in your project, you have to set up a few things.
Follow the steps below to get started.<br />
_Note:_ For the best experience, we recommend using MailingUI in a **Next.js** project with **TypeScript**.

### (Optional) 1. Bootstrap a new Next.js project

If you already have a Next.js project, you can skip this step.
Also, if you intend to use MailingUI in a different project, you can skip this step.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

### Install MailingUI dependencies

MailingUI builds on top of [react-email](https://react.email), you have to install it into your project.


```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

### Copy common MailingUI utilities into your project (@mailingui/themes)

Currently, the only shared utility we use in the components are **themes**.
Themes allow you to easily change the look of your emails by changing only a few lines of code.

Create a folder called `themes` somewhere in your project (we recommend `src/mailingui/themes`) and copy
[this file](https://github.com/webscopeio/mailingui-web/blob/main/src/mailingui/themes/index.ts) into it.
This file holds the theme that we then import in our components.
Feel free to change the variables inside the theme.

### (Recommended) Setup tsconfig.json aliases

If `tsconfig.json` aliases are not set up, you will have to manually change all the imports in all the components.
Add the following lines to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@mailingui/components": ["src/mailingui/components/index.ts"],
      "@mailingui/themes": ["src/mailingui/themes/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

_Note:_ If you are using a different folder structure, you will have to change the paths in the `tsconfig.json` file.

Now you should be able to use MailingUI components in your project.
Just click on one of the components below and follow the instructions on how to include it in your project.
