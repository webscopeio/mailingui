# MailingUI components

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components designed to make the creation of emails easier.

All of our components are intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets, you **cannot install MailingUI
as a dependency**.
Right now, we are not planning on releasing an npm package for the components.

## Installation

To start using MailingUI in your project, you have to set up a few things.
Follow the steps below to get started.<br />
_Note:_ For the best experience, we recommend using MailingUI in a **Next.js** project with **TypeScript**.

### (Optional) Bootstrap a new Next.js project

If you already have a Next.js project, you can skip this step.
Also, if you intend to use MailingUI in a different project, you can skip this step.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

### Install MailingUI dependencies

MailingUI builds on top of [react-email](https://react.email), you have to install it into your project.


```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

### Create a theme file

To allow quick and easy customization of the components, our components consume a theme that you can modify
to fit your needs.

To set up theming create a folder called `themes` in your project (we recommend `src/mailingui/themes`),
create a file named `index.ts` inside the folder and paste the following code into it.

```typescript
export const theme = {
  color: {
    background: {
      "100": "#ffffff",
      "200": "#ffffff",
      "300": "#ffffff",
      "400": "#ffffff",
    },
    foreground: {
      "100": "#000000",
      "200": "#000000",
      "300": "#000000",
      "400": "#000000",
    },
    brand: "#000000",
  },
  rounded: {
    base: 0,
    full: 9999,
  },
} as const;
````

This theme object is completely arbitrary, feel free to modify it to fit your needs.
**If you add or remove any of these keys-values** you will need to update the components as well.

### (Recommended) Setup tsconfig.json aliases

If `tsconfig.json` aliases are not set up, you will have to manually change all the imports in all the components.
Add the following lines to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@mailingui/components": ["src/mailingui/components/index.ts"],
      "@mailingui/themes": ["src/mailingui/themes/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

> _Note:_ If you are using a different folder structure, you will have to change the paths in the `tsconfig.json` file.

If you used the same naming as us, your file structure should include the following files:

```tree
├── /src
│   ├── /mailingui
│   │   ├── /themes
│   │   │   ├── /index.ts
│   │   ├── /components
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

Now you should be able to use MailingUI components in your project.
Just click on one of the components below and follow the instructions on how to include it in your project.
