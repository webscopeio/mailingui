# Getting started

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components designed to make the creation of emails easier.

All of our components are intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets, you **cannot install MailingUI
as a dependency**.
Right now, we have no plans on creating an npm package for the components.

## Installation

<DocCollapsible>

To start using MailingUI in your project, you have to set up a few things.
Follow the steps below to get started.<br />
_Note:_ For the best experience, we recommend using MailingUI in a **Next.js** project with **TypeScript**.

### (Optional) Bootstrap a new Next.js project

If you already have a Next.js project, you can skip this step.
Also, if you intend to use MailingUI in a different project, you can skip this step.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

  <Tabs defaultValue="automatic">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-start w-full mb-8">
      <TabsList className="mt-8 rounded-2xl">
        <TabsTrigger value="automatic" className="px-7 py-2 rounded-[10px]">Automatic Install</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="manual" className="px-7 py-2 rounded-[10px]">Manual Install</TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
    </div>

    <TabsContent value="automatic" className="md:space-y-12 space-y-8 rounded-2xl bg-dark-950 p-6">
      ## Automatic Install with `@mailingui/cli`

      ### Initialize MailingUI

      Initialize MailingUI in your projects. The command downloads all the necessary files for you to start working with MailingUI.

      ```shell
      npx @mailingui/cli init [options]

      # Options
      -p, --path <path>  define base path to your MailingUI components (default: "./src/@mailingui")
      -o, --overwrite    overwrite existing configuration (default: false)
      -h, --help         display help for command
      ```

      ### Adding Component(s)

      Add all or specific components to your project. Refer to the list of components on [our website](/docs).

      ```shell
      npx @mailingui/cli add [options] [components...]

      # Options
      -o, --overwrite  automatically overwrite existing components (default: false)
      -a, --all        download all available components (default: false)
      -h, --help       display help for command
      ```
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="manual" className="md:space-y-12 rounded-2xl bg-dark-950 p-6">
      ## Manual Install

      ### Install MailingUI dependencies and components

      MailingUI builds on top of [react-email](https://react.email), you have to install it into your project.

      ```bash
      npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
      ```

      Once you've install these dependencies you can copy and paste the components you need. Please visit [mailingui.com/components](https://mailingui.com/components) to see all of our components.

      ### Create a theme file

      To allow quick and easy customization of the components, our components consume a theme that you can modify
      to fit your needs.

      To set up theming create a folder called `themes` in your project (we recommend `src/mailingui/themes`),
      create a file named `index.ts` inside the folder and paste the following code into it.

      ```typescript
      export const theme = {
      color: {
      background: {
      "100": "#ffffff",
      "200": "#ffffff",
      "300": "#ffffff",
      "400": "#ffffff",
      },
        foreground: {
        "100": "#000000",
        "200": "#000000",
        "300": "#000000",
        "400": "#000000",
      },
        brand: "#000000",
      },
        rounded: {
        base: 0,
        full: 9999,
      },
      } as const;
      ```

      This theme object is completely arbitrary, feel free to modify it to fit your needs.
      **If you add or remove any of these keys-values** you will need to update the components as well.

  </Tabs>

        ### Final Steps - Setup tsconfig.json path aliases

      If `tsconfig.json` aliases are not set up, you will have to manually change all the imports in all the components.
      Add the following lines to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@mailingui/components": ["src/mailingui/components/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

> _Note:_ If you are using a different folder structure, you will have to change the paths in the `tsconfig.json` file.

If you used the same naming as us, your file structure should include the following files:

```tree
├── /src
│   ├── /mailingui
│   │   ├── /themes
│   │   │   ├── /index.ts
│   │   ├── /components
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

Now you should be able to use MailingUI components in your project.
Just click on one of the components below and follow the instructions on how to include it in your project.
