# MailingUI components

## Installation

MailingUI components are intended to be used as copy paste. Some common setup steps are required in your project for individual components to work.

1. Initialize NextJs app (if not already done)

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

2. Install MailingUI dependencies

```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

TODO: specify versions?

3. Copy common MailingUI utilities to your project (@mailingui/themes)

```bash
cp something
```

TODO: How to do this with full folder?

4. (Recommended) Setup tsconfig.json aliases

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@mailingui/components": ["src/mailingui/components/index.ts"],
      "@mailingui/themes": ["src/mailingui/themes/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now you should be able to use MailingUI components in your project.  
It might be necessary to update paths to match your project structure.
