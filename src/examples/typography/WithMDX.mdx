Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.

## The King's Plan

The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with a [brilliant plan](#): he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.

> "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that they should pay for the privilege."

### The Joke Tax

As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.

#### People stopped telling jokes

The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error of his ways and repealed the joke tax.

Some of them were asked to install the package: `npm i @jokester`

## Lessons from Jokester: The Top Jokes

Jokester had a repertoire of hilarious jokes that brought joy to the kingdom. Here are some of the funniest ones:

3. How do you organize a space party? You "planet"!

Jokester's wisdom touched hearts and lifted spirits across the land.
