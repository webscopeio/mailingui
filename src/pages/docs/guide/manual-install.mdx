# Manual Install

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components, built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), designed to make the creation of emails easier. Before you continue, make sure to read [Getting Started - Introduction](/docs/guide/introduction).

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

We need [React.email](https://react.email) **components** as our baseline and their **render** utility function to transform your emails into HTML.

```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

If you are planning to write your emails using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). You will also need:

```bash
npm install @mdx-js/react
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We assume you have an integration to compile MDX to JS, such as
  `@mdx-js/esbuild`, `@mdx-js/loader`, `@mdx-js/node-loader`, or
  `@mdx-js/rollup` in place. If you don't, please refer to [MDX
  Packages](https://mdxjs.com/packages/).
</Callout>

### Create your working sub-directories

Whether you call it MailingUI or not is up to you. We recommend setting up a working directories where your emails, their components, theming, utils and assets will be.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="emails" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="assets" defaultOpen />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mailingui" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="components" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.Folder name="themes" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.Folder name="utils" defaultOpen />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Set up themes and utils

Emails **just work differently**, there is no good solution for theming. Our components are styled using a theme config (fancy way of calling our theme object) that you can modify to fit your branding needs for quick and easy customization.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
 We recommend creating an index file to manage all the exports from these files, specially if using path aliases. One for themes, one for utils.
</Callout>

<Code name="types" filename="/themes/types.ts" lang="ts"  />

<Code name="theme" filename="/themes/theme.ts" lang="ts"  />

<Code name="utils" filename="/utils/utils.ts" lang="ts"  />


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This theme config is completely arbitrary but completely type safe, feel free
  to take aid in its types and modify it to fit your needs. Just make sure to check your components.
</Callout>

### Configure your path aliases (optional)

Create path aliases to help you write email templates easier while using MailingUI

```ts copy
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    {...}
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@mailingui/components": ["./src/mailingui/components/index.ts"],
      "@mailingui/themes": ["./src/mailingui/themes/index.ts"],
      "@mailingui/utils": ["./src/mailingui/utils/index.ts"]
    }
  },
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Path alias depends on where you decide to install your MailingUI components. Example above shows installation in `./src/mailingui`
</Callout>

</Steps>

Congratulations! 🥳 Once you've install these dependencies you can copy and paste the components you need. See [components](/docs/components) for the full list.
