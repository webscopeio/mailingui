# Manual Install

<Steps>
### Install dependencies and components

MailingUI is built on top of [React.email](https://react.email) components and uses its `render` function to parse React into HTML.

```bash
npm install @react-email/components @react-email/render
```

### Create a theme file

Email components **just work differently**, there is no good solution for theming. Our components reference a theme object that you can modify to fit your branding needs and allow quick and easy customization.

To set up a theming, create a folder called `src/mailingui/themes` in your project and colocate a file named `index.ts` inside the folder and paste the following code into it.

```ts copy
export const theme = {
  color: {
    background: {
      "100": "#ffffff",
      "200": "#ffffff",
      "300": "#ffffff",
      "400": "#ffffff",
    },
    foreground: {
      "100": "#000000",
      "200": "#000000",
      "300": "#000000",
      "400": "#000000",
    },
    brand: "#000000",
  },
  rounded: {
    base: 0,
    full: 9999,
  },
} as const;
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This theme object is completely arbitrary, feel free to modify it to fit your
  needs. However, **if you add or remove any of the existing keys-values** you will need to
  update the components as well.
</Callout>

</Steps>

Congratulations! 🥳 Once you've install these dependencies you can copy and paste the components you need. See [components](/docs/components) for the full list.
