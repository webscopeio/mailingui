# Theming

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components, built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), designed to make the creation of emails easier. Before you continue, make sure to read [Getting Started - Introduction](/docs/guide/introduction).

Theming MailingUI components is powered by our **theme config** (fancy way of calling our theme object). Although this object could end up being completely different to the starting point we offer, it will give you typesafety and give you the sense of utility classes and merged styles in your components using inline CSS (which is ultimately the safest way to style Email).

You have two options to update theming:

## Modifying the theme config

Scenario: We want to create a `Lead` component. So we will introduce a new color and a new variant to use in our MailingUI components.

<Steps>

### Adding Colors

Add any color in _three_ easy steps:

```ts copy filename="/themes/theme.ts"
// 1. ADD A COLOR VARIANT (i.e., "hotpink")
// This is how your color will be referenced as
type ColorVariants = "global" | "hotpink";

// 2. DECLARE ITS CSS COLOR VALUE
// Completely type-safe and with autocompletion
const colors: ThemeColors = {
  global: "#262626",
  hotpink: "hotpink"
};

// 3. USE YOUR NEW COLOR
// Completely type-safe and with autocompletion
export const theme: Theme = {
  global: {
    fontFamily: "system-ui, sans-serif",
    color: colors.hotpink,
  },
  {...}
};
```

### Creating a style

Add any style in _three_ easy steps:

```ts copy filename="/themes/theme.ts"
// 1. ADD A THEME VARIANT (i.e., "lead")
// This is how your style will be referenced as
type ThemeVariants =
  | "global"
  | "headings"
  | "lead"

// 2. DECLARE ITS CSS STYLE
// Completely type-safe and with autocompletion
export const theme: Theme = {
  global: {
    fontFamily: "system-ui, sans-serif",
    color: colors.hotpink,
  },
  lead: {
    fontSize: remToPx(1.5),
    fontStyle: "italic",
    fontWeight: 500,
  },
  {...}
};
```

```ts copy filename="/components/Lead.tsx"
// 3. USE YOUR NEW STYLE
// Completely type-safe and with autocompletion
import * as React from "react";
import { cx } from "@mailingui/utils";

export const Lead: React.FC<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"p">> = ({
  style,
  ...props
}) => <p style={cx(["global", "lead", style])} {...props} />;
```

</Steps>

## Using `cx` to apply styles

Taking an obvious inspiration, we've created an `cx` utility function to apply styles. It's code is simple but yet effective at its job. This is how we use it:

```ts copy filename="/components/Lead.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { cx } from "@mailingui/utils";

export const Lead: React.FC<
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"p"> & { small?: boolean }
> = ({ small, style, ...props }) => (
  // You can add theme variant keys and CSS properties, both conditionally
  <p
    style={cx(["global", "lead", small && { fontSize: "14px" }, style])}
    {...props}
  />
);
```

## Using MDX and context themes

If you are using MDX and will need to update theme on an email-basis. You have the option to enable your components with a `theme` prop and pass it in your `cx` function. You do not need this if you plan to manage your themes exclusively with the theme config.

```ts copy filename="/components/Lead.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { Theme } from "@mailingui/themes";
import { cx } from "@mailingui/utils";

export const Lead: React.FC<
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"p"> & { small?: boolean; theme?: Theme }
> = ({ small, theme, style, ...props }) => (
  // Add your theme using a prop and `cx`
  <p
    style={cx(["global", "lead", small && { fontSize: "14px" }, style], {
      theme,
    })}
    {...props}
  />
);
```

Then use the `Markdown` component to pass custom theme styles:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

import { Body, Container, Html, Head, Row, Column } from "@react-email/components";

import Example from "./CustomStyles.mdx";
import { Markdown, Lead } from "@mailingui/components";

export default function Email() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Body>
        <Container>
          <Row>
            <Column>
              <Markdown
                theme={{
                  lead: {
                    fontFamily:
                      "'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif",
                  },
                }}
              >
                <Example title="Latest News" />
              </Markdown>
            </Column>
          </Row>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You're set for theming. Go ahead and make email feel a bit more modern and less 2010.
