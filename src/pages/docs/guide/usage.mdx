# Usage

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components, built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), designed to make the creation of emails easier. Before you continue, make sure to read [Getting Started - Introduction](/docs/guide/introduction).

MailingUI uses [React.email](https://react.email) `render` utility function to parse React into HTML that is optimized for various email clients. Once the HTML markup is rendered, you have the flexibility to employ any preferred email sending service or library to effectively deliver your emails.

Let's explore how to use **MailingUI** components to create emails and send them using [Resend](https://resend.com/). For alternative providers, please refer to [React.email Integrations](https://react.email/docs/integrations/overview).

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

```bash copy
npm install resend
```

### Create email template

Use any of your **MailingUI** components along with any other [React.email Components](https://react.email/docs/components/html) to create your email template just like any other React component. Here's an example:

```ts copy filename="/emails/email.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import {
  Html,
  Head,
  Body,
  Container,
  Row,
  Column,
} from "@react-email/components";

import Demo from "./Demo.mdx";
import { Typography } from "@mailingui/components";

export default function Email({ greeting }: { greeting: string }) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Body style={body}>
        <Container style={container}>
          <Row style={row}>
            <Column>
              <Typography.P>{greeting}</Typography.P>
            </Column>
          </Row>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}

export const body: React.CSSProperties = {
  backgroundColor: "#fafafa", // Background color outside container
  margin: 0, // Margin reset
};

export const container: React.CSSProperties = {
  backgroundColor: "#fff", // Email background color
  padding: "60px 30px", // We remove inline padding to enable full-width banners
  maxWidth: "600px", // Estalbish the maximum size of the email
};
```

### Send email

The most common practice for sending emails is to manage them through API Routes. This example showcases Next Route handlers for this.

Resend is the company behind React.email, therefore Resend's SDK is able to process React components as directly in place of HTML.

```ts copy filename="/api/email/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Resend } from "resend";
import Email from "./src/emails/Email";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function POST() {
  // You would process the payload from the request to parametrize your email
  try {
    const data = await resend.emails.send({
      from: process.env.RESEND_SENDER,
      to: "vorcak@webscope.io",
      subject: "Greetings",
      react: Email({
        greeting: "Hello, Jan Vorcak!",
      }),
    });
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error });
  }
}
```

</Steps>
