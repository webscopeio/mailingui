# Usage

MailingUI is built on top of [React.email](https://react.email) components and uses its `render` function to parse React into HTML that is optimized for various email clients. Once the HTML markup is rendered, you have the flexibility to employ any preferred email sending service or library to effectively deliver your emails.

Let's explore how to use **MailingUI** components to create emails and send them using [Resend](https://resend.com/). For alternative providers, please refer to [React.email Integrations](https://react.email/docs/integrations/overview).

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

Once you've install MailingUI and its dependencies successfully (otherwise please refer to [Introduction](/docs/guide/introduction)), you can install Resend's SDK:

```bash copy
npm install resend
```

### Create email template

Use your **MailingUI** components along with any other [React.email Components](https://react.email/docs/components/html) to create your email template just like any other React component. Here's an example:

```tsx copy
import { Body, Container, Html, Row } from "@react-email/components";
import { Text } from "@mailingui/components";

type GreetingProps = {
  username: string;
};

const Greeting = ({ username }: GreetingProps) => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Body style={main}>
        <Container style={container} width={600}>
          <Row style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
            <Text style={{ fontSize: "32px" }}>Hello, {username}!</Text>
          </Row>
          <Row>
            <Text>Greetings from MailingUI and React.email using Resend</Text>
          </Row>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
};
export default Greeting;

const main = {
  backgroundColor: "#f6f9fc",
  padding: "60px 0 122px 0",
};

const container = {
  backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
  border: "1px solid #f0f0f0",
  padding: "40px",
  fontFamily: "'Inter', sans-serif",
};
```

### Send email

The most common practice for sending emails is to manage them through API Routes. This example showcases Next Route handlers for this.

Resend is the company behind React.email, therefore Resend's SDK is able to process React components as directly in place of HTML.

```ts copy
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Resend } from "resend";
import Greeting from "./src/emails/Greeting";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function POST() {
  // You would process the payload from the request to parametrize your email
  try {
    const data = await resend.emails.send({
      from: process.env.RESEND_SENDER,
      to: "vorcak@webscope.io",
      subject: "Greetings",
      react: Greeting({
        username: "vorcak",
      }),
    });
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error });
  }
}
```

</Steps>
