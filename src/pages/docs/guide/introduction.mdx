# Getting Started

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components, built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), designed to make the creation of emails easier.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  When thinking about how is MailingUI built on top of [React.email](https://react.email), think about how [Shad's UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).
</Callout>

## Why

> "We believe that email is an extremely important medium for people to communicate. However, we need to stop developing emails like 2010, and rethink how email can be done in 2022 and beyond. Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build web apps today"  
—[React.email](https://react.email).

## How to use

All of our components are completely **open-sourced** and intended for a
*copy-and-paste* use. Currently, we don't have any plans in releasing MailingUI as an npm
package.

We do realize that asking you to _copy-and-paste_ everything might slow you down. Therefore, we've created a CLI for an [automatic install](/docs/guide/automatic-install) to make things easier.

## Installation

Just like [React.email](https://react.email), you can incrementally adopt MailingUI into any TypeScript project using React. You can choose an automatic install using our CLI `@mailingui/cli` or copy-and-paste MailingUI's building blocks to get started:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<TerminalIcon />}
    title="Automatic Installation"
    href="/docs/guide/automatic-install"
  />
  <Card
    icon={<CopyIcon />}
    title="Manual Installation"
    href="/docs/guide/manual-install"
  />
</Cards>
