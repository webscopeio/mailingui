# Getting Started

MailingUI is a set of _opinionated_ React components built on top of [React.email](https://react.email) designed to make the creation of emails easier.

All of our components are completely open-sourced and intended to be used as copy-and-paste snippets. Right now, we have no plans on creating an npm package for the components. 

However, we have enabled an [automatic install](/docs/guide/automatic-install) through our own CLI which will make the installation of components easier.

## Prerequisites

To use MailingUI components in your project, you have to set up a few things.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
We recommend using MailingUI in a [Next](https://nextjs.org/) project, as all of our examples are based on using this framework.
</Callout>


### Create a new Next project (optional)

If you already have a Next project or would like to use MailingUI with a different React framework, you can skip this step.

```bash copy
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

### Choose an installation method

You are able to use our MailingUI CLI or manually install our components:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<TerminalIcon />}
    title="Automatic Installation"
    href="/docs/guide/automatic-install"
  />
  <Card
    icon={<CopyIcon />}
    title="Manual Installation"
    href="/docs/guide/manual-install"
  />
</Cards>
